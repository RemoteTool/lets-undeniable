## Discords recent actions and decisions have been nothing but a joke.
Reason discord is trash:
```sh-session
* Switching every bot over to slash commands
* Discord and YouTube partnership forcing music bots out of business
* Locks a lot of features behind Nitro
* Against BetterDiscord and custom clients
* Hides behind their TOS to avoid lengthy user questions
* Discord hypocrisy, introducing alt account system, when they want to prevent spam and raids
* Discord's new terms of service that is vague and broad
* Considering punishing users for off-platform abuse
* Attempting to police possible misinformation.
* Discord banning users for reporting clearly illegal servers.
* Discord shafting their user base to please their investor overlords.
* Discord banning more innocents than guiltys.
```

### Discord ban fair community and don't ban scammer servers

Discord is not a small company now and have had the resources for a long time to protect its users in multiple ways but yet decide to focus on features such as profile decoration (coming soon...). Get the feeling that they haven't made a system to prevent token loggers and such just so skids can grab peoples accounts and buy nitro, thus profiting discord in an illegal way. 

I think discord would look alot better if it was a platform were actions such as selling cheats would be acceptable and quite enjoyable for alot of people. The only thing discord has is its advantage being the first easy, clean, noob friendly platform to talk with friends on, making it the platform everyone flooded too making it hard to move to other platforms since everyone is on discord. 

Before the days of teamspeak (old one), skype etc.. Discord was huge and was growing quick and didn't really have to care about all this token grabbing stuff I feel like. But now 5 years later they still haven't changed their system. I'd rather just have discord sell itself to microsoft so they can fix this shitty ass platform.

They've banned multiple trusted servers with happy members and yet don't ban servers that are dedicated to scamming kids with things such as image loggers.

When i sent a big email with lot of proofs their shit moderation bot doesn't do nothing, while the report bot accept fake mass spammed reports from spam bots ?
